<h3>SAARTHI</h3>
</span>

Introducing SAARTHI, a platform for the education of the visually impaired. During this period of pandemic the visually impaired don’t have any kind of access to education in person. Hence, a need of a portal arises via which these people could continue their education. With SAARTHI we want to give them the right to education. These people who are left out, will get the resources and the opportunity to gain knowledge from all the available text books out there. This is a school of hard knocks with a ride in the short bus. This just doesn’t stick to this pandemic period, rather it also extends to help out those children as well who are not in an able condition to move to their place of education.

**“It shouldn’t matter how slowly some children learn as long as we are encouraging them not to stop.” – Robert John Meehan**

## What and How we implemented?
We implemented a web portal for the people to facilitate them in education by providing them the tools which will help them learn. A fully Voice Controlled Website with OCR based feature to convert pdf into audio books. This turned out to be very helpful for visually impaired to read books in pdf format. Along with that we also implemented voice synthesizer which basically is a speech-to-text converter to write content without typing making everything voice controllable.

## In What depth did we implement, what we wanted to and Future Developments if any.
We tried to implement multiple features like Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Optical Character recognition that is Revoice, Voice Controlled. In Future Developments, We can try implementing a chat to help them with their queries. We would like to improve upon the feasibility of the voice control feature and accuracy of the optical character recognition.

## Instructions to run the project

To run the project please install the following libraries and frameworks:

1. Install everything mentioned in requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. tesseract-ocr
```
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

3.  Poppler-utils
```
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

After installing all the requirements, run-server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## What is the Potential? How useful or efficient can it be to people?
This can be used to many people not just specific to the Visually impaired but hearing impaired as well. This would come to a great use during this pandemic but even later it can be used by people who are physically challenged and cannot move to different places to receive their education.
